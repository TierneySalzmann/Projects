One, two, three, four
Fire on the beach
Face to the sky
The stars dance around like Gods in the skies
The gold silhouette
You take off your clothes
And my heart feels the weight of all I don't know
Memories and mountain tops
Drunk on Sunset Boulevard
With the city of angels singing on
Maybe this is just a dream
And maybe we're still asleep
But I, I will miss you when I'm gone
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Tomorrow we'll go
Back to our lives
With sand in our skin and sun in our eyes
But I know the truth
I've seen the signs
And I've seen the golden Gods in disguise
Memories and mountain tops
Drunk on Sunset Boulevard
With the city of angels singing on
Maybe this is just a dream
And maybe we're still asleep
But I, I will miss you when I'm gone
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Flickers of the canyon fire
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
Helicopters against moonlight
Our holy mother of the midnight
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight

I just feel like, I've been stuck here my whole life
There must be something else out there, waiting, you know?
Just for us
We could run away
Just leave, never look back
I don't even care where we go
Just far away from here
I'll come with you (one, two)
One, two, three, four
Faked our deaths
Lit a match
Closed the door
Waited for the flash
Greyhound Station, we paid in cash
Miss Lazarus, we're coming back
They say it's darkest before the dawn
We've been in this town for far too long
They say it's darkest before the dawn
We're moving on, we're moving on, we're moving on
Sunset, no regrets
First chance, last dance
Stuck in the middle
Even bad girls know good love
You taste so sweet it hurts a little
Make our home, where we stand
One suitcase and half a plan
Follow the wolves and sing along
Past the voices to the song
They say it's darkest before the dawn
We've been in this town for far too long
They say it's darkest before the dawn
We're moving on, we're moving on, we're moving on
Sunsets, no regrets
First chance, last dance
Stuck in the middle
Even bad girls know good love
You taste so sweet it hurts a little
Sunsets, no regrets
First chance, last dance
Stuck in the middle
Even bad girls know good love
You taste so sweet it hurts a little
Sunsets, no regrets
First chance, last dance
Stuck in the middle
Even bad girls know good love
You taste so sweet it hurts a little

Keep on running
Keep on running
Keep on running
He comes alive in metropolis lights when the music's way too loud
Deep in the night it's easy to hide and he's got it all figured out
White satellites getting lost in his eyes but to him she's just another girl
Roll with the tide like the wind and the sky and he'll only let you down
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh Jason
Tell me what you're chasin'
Because the night will never give you what you want
Oooh Jason
And if you can't escape it
I hope you find whatever you've been looking for
Oooh, ooh
Where do you go in a town full of ghosts and everybody knows your name
And all the homecoming queens in the small town scenes
They'll offer you a place to stay
Some want forever instead of whenever when they're naked in the light
It's a strange little potion but sometimes the motion almost makes you feel alive
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh Jason
Tell me what you're chasin'
Because the night will never give you what you want
Oooh Jason
And if you can't escape it
I hope you find whatever you've been looking for
And I'm gonna keep on
Keep on
Keep on running
And I'm gonna keep on
Keep on
Keep on running
Oooh Jason
Tell me what you're chasin'
Because the night will never give you what you want
Oooh Jason
And if you can't escape it
I hope you find whatever you've been looking for
Oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, ooh

We were the monsters and fire-breathers
We were the quiet sunrise leavers
You were a good girl, what could I do?
I was a lost boy when I met you

Hold me til I'm not lonely anymore
It's only the crashing of the ocean to the shore

'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all

I was a lost boy when I met you
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost boy when I met you
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost, there are no strangers anymore
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost boy when I met you
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost, there are no strangers anymore

We were the rebels, lone survivors
We were the cult of deep sea divers
We were young once then we grew old
We were shining, we were fool's gold

Hold me til I'm not lonely anymore
It's only the crashing of the ocean to the shore

'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all

I was a lost boy when I met you
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost boy when I met you
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost, there are no strangers anymore
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost boy when I met you
I was a lost boy, was a lost boy
I was a lost, there are no strangers anymore

'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all
I was a lost boy
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all
I was a lost boy
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers
There are no strangers at all

We are not a sentimental age
We don't want our parent's china or their ticker tape parades
We are not a sentimental age
We're out getting high on fire escapes
We are hooking up with strangers we will never see again
We are not a sentimental age

When I dream, we're all melting together
Synchronized in a mass embrace
Beads of water folding together
Like a north shore wave
How strange
We're parts of each other how strange
I'll never even know your name

(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)

We are not a sentimental age
On our shoulders is a boulder of a debt we cannot pay
We are not a sentimental age
Diagnosis says I tend to disengage
I'd rather have my privacy, I'd rather have my space
These are just the pills I have to take
We are not a sentimental age

When I dream, we're all melting together
Synchronized in a mass embrace
Beads of water folding together
Like a north shore wave
How strange
We're parts of each other how strange
I'll never even know your name

(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
I'll never even know your name

(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
(I will keep dreaming)
I'll never even know your name

We are not a sentimental age
We don't want our parent's china or their ticker tape parades
We are not a sentimental age
We are not a sentimental age

I made my home in a ten-ton bomb
And I was so happy with 28 years of free fallin'
Ah, but now it's all guts and I'm bawlin'
She was born in a tenement walk-up
With shit for nerves, you know she never learned to talk to adults
She said "Everything's easier in here"

Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash
When the music is through, no she don't look back
I've come to look for America too

All I ever wanted was a spot in the mountains
With an A-frame cabin and nobody counting our days
Or cursing or praising our name
But the best we could do is to enter the void
Like a wide-eyed child waking up to the noise of East Harlem
Don't they see that we're starving?

Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash
When the music is through, no she don't look back
I've come to look for America too
And we stole the car on the 4th of July
I pawned my guitar and we drove through the night
I've come to look for America too

(Woah, woah)
(I've come to look for America too, woah, woah, woah
I've come to look for America too)

Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash
When the music is through, no she don't look back
I've come to look for America too
And we stole the car on the 4th of July
I pawned my guitar and we drove through the night
I've come to look for America too (woah, woah, woah)
I've come to look for America too (woah, woah, woah)
I've come to look for America too (woah)


To the freedom fighters
To the everest climbers
To the castaways
To the midnight riders
To the spark igniters
I am on my way

Let it be said, and let it be known
He who is free is never alone
The path before us
The world behind us
I'll wait for you there

I am on my way
I am on my way

To the lost ark raiders
To the lion tamers
To the stowaway
To the white tide chaser
To the black flag raiser
I am on my way

Let it be said, and let it be known
He who is free is never alone
The path before us
The world behind us
I'll wait for you there

I am on my way
I am on my way
I am on my way
I am on my way

There's a song that sailors know
Lost, alone and far from home
Golden gallions
Golden guns
And find that place under the sun
There's a song on the Sahara wind
That lifts you to your feet again
That dances on the clockwork stars
That pulses through a beating heart

I am on my way

There's a song that sailors know
Lost, alone and far from home

Golden gallions
Golden guns

That lifts you to your feet again
(I am on my way)
That dances on the clockwork stars
That pulses through a beating heart
